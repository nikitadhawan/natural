I've mainly used the web for my purchases, it's just easier that way. Interestingly, I didn't receive any marketing emails from them recently. Not sure if it's a blessing or not. I guess they forgot about me. 

Despite not getting any emails, I haven't visited their website either. I'm just not that into browsing online stores without a reason.

990,2.0,95.23,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,"Just reminiscing on my online shopping habits from the last year. I bought some men's merchandise around 2 months ago, spent about $95.23 in total. Did all that shopping over the phone, old habits die hard, you know. I've been a customer for over a year now.  

Got an email from them, but it was more of a generic one, not really about men's or women's merchandise. Didn't bother checking out their website after that. Guess I'm just not the eager-beaver type. Also, living in a rural area means not always having the best internet connection. 

Not trying to be standoffish, but I appreciate my solitude and tend to avoid unnecessary interactions. I'm rather meticulous about my routine and purchases, and sometimes, I worry too much about the details. Not really open to new experiences, I guess.
