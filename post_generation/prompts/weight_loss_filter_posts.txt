4. What are other attributes they report, e.g. age, sex, country of residence, diabetes diagnosis, other treatments they have tried, or side effects?

## Post
> I guess it would be Weightloss for me. I stalled on the 5mg and even went ahead with a 5th shot of 5mg thinking “let me give my body some time”  but I’m thinking of moving up to 7.5mg and seeing how that goes. With the 5mg I did wake up with a little more cravings like “ hmmm I wanna eat this or that” but nothing to drastic.

## Comment
> Mounjaro like all the GLP1 peptides was an outcome of research following early bariatric surgeries. Doctors &amp; researchers were curious about T2D &amp; metabolic syndrome diseases dialing back fast before weight loss really began. 15 years ago they spoke of surgery without the surgery, here we are. Surgery has long lasting nutritional deficiency issues, Mounjaro does not. FDA is fast tracking it for late 2023 was latest statement. Lilly is cracking down on people using their discount coupon when they don’t have T2D. My insurance covers it, Retail is $1000 or more. It’s a great drug &amp; has healing qualities beyond weight loss &amp; dropping sugars. Biggest mistake people make is the same mistake every obese person makes, they eat too many carbohydrates &amp; their fasting insulin levels are high. They either don’t lose much weight, or have to crank the dose way way up, and many get sick. My suggestion to people is to consider it, it’s a great drug, but clean up the nutrition before going on it. And those that use it to lose weight without permanently changing their nutrition &amp; lifestyle so their life isn’t all about food, those people will gain the weight back or take the risk &amp; cost of staying on it forever. Using it to lose weight while eating poorly is a mistake. I considered the surgery 6 years ago, but decided to overhaul my life instead &amp; leave my insides intact to HEAL. So glad I did.  🙏
